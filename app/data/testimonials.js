Dr. Horn was very knowledgeable and showed us different angles of X-rays and explained why our son’s tooth couldn’t be saved. He was very compassionate and helped this momma be at peace about what needs to be done with my son. I have been praying for direction as we’ve seen multiple doctors in the last couple of weeks and I know Dr. Horn has been an answer to my prayers.",
