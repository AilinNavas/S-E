        question: 'What is a root canal?',
        answer: 'A root canal is a dental procedure that removes infected or damaged pulp from inside a tooth. The pulpcontains nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. After removing the pulp, the inside of the tooth is cleaned, disinfected, and filled with a rubber-like material called gutta-percha. This procedure saves the natural tooth and prevents the need for extraction.',
