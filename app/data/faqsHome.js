        question: ' What is a root canal?',
        answer: '  A root canal is a dental procedure that removes infected or damaged pulp from inside a tooth. The pulpcontains nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. After removing the pulp, the inside of the tooth is cleaned, disinfected, and filled with a rubber-like material called gutta-percha. This procedure saves the natural tooth and prevents the need for extraction.',
      },
      {
        question: ' Is a root canal painful?',
        answer: "Modern root canal procedures are virtually painless thanks to advanced techniques, effective anesthesia, and our experienced team. Most patients report that the procedure is no more uncomfortable than having a filling placed.",
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does a root canal take?',
        answer: 'Most root canal treatments can be completed in one or two appointments, depending on the complexity of the case. A typical appointment lasts between 60 to 90 minutes. Our use of advanced TDO software helps streamline the process and reduce treatment time.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I know if I need a root canal? ',
        answer: '  Common signs that you might need a root canal include severe tooth pain, prolonged sensitivity to hot or cold, discoloration of the tooth, swelling and tenderness in nearby gums, and a persistent or recurring pimple on the gums. If you experience any of these symptoms, we recommend scheduling an appointment for an evaluation.',
      },
      {
        question: ' Does insurance cover endodontic treatment? ',
        answer: '  Most dental insurance plans provide some coverage for endodontic treatment. The amount of coverage varies depending on your specific plan. Our office staff will work with you to maximize your insurance benefits and can help you understand your coverage before treatment begins.',
      },
      {
        question: '  What happens after a root canal?',
        answer: "After your root canal is complete, you'll need to return to your general dentist for a permanent restoration (usually a crown) to protect the treated tooth. Until then, avoid chewing on the treated tooth, practice good oral hygiene, and take any prescribed medications as directed. Most patients can return to their normal activities the day after the procedure."
