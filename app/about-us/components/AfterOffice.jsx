                Beyond his dedication to dentistry, Dr. Horn enjoys spending time with his wife, Leslie, and their three
                children, Miles, Audrey, and Parker. He is an avid baseball fan, cheering for the Texas Rangers, and has
                a passion for gardeningâ€”especially native Texas plants. He also cares for a variety of exotic pets and
                orchids.

                Dr. Horn believes in giving back to the community and regularly participates in dental outreach
                programs. His experience living in Argentina gave him a deep appreciation for different cultures.

                When not in the office, you might find Dr. Horn at a local baseball game, tending to his garden, or
                exploring Fort Worth's vibrant cultural scene with his family.
